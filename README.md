# Bank

The idea behind this project is based on my
[Python wallet project](https://github.com/mrroot5/django-atomic-transactions).

## Features

WIP.

## Up & running

```shell
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f web
```

## Why I did the project this way?

Pleas check [whys](./whys/README.md) folder.
